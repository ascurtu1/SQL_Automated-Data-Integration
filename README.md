# PostgreSQL_Automated-Data-Integration

In this project, I analyzed a database and extracted the necessary data to create two business reports showing total revenue for each store location owned by a company. I also created an aggregate function, trigger, and stored procedure. These were used to perform an ETL load process to maintain data freshness and provide an accurate representation of the extracted data in the created reports. The end result was a complete automated data integration process.
